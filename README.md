# Gift Ideas For Teachers

"Your one stop holiday shop for finding the perfect gift for your teacher this holiday season.
Simply answer the questions and we will return a filtered collection of teacher-approved gifts at a variety of price points."

This Django/Python application takes a series of user responses to generate the perfect gift for a child's teacher. By answering a few simple questions, the database is reduced to choices that are appropriate for the person described. Hosted on Heroku, this application is worth the waiting for it to load.
